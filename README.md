## Git and GitHub 

The task introduced me to a basic usage of Git, how it works and its features.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

About navigating through the file system, changing and working with files. Such things like aliases, `sed` and `grep` were new for me. I also got familiar with HTTP.

## Git Collaboration

In this part it was useful to read about `fetch`, practice with ancestry references, `revert`, `reset` and also I refresh my knowledge about merging and `rebase` command. Despite on the first task courses were very helpful.
